{"name":"Sick Beard for Newshost v0.2.4 build 499","tagline":"Modified version of SickBeard and provider for Newshost","body":"### Modifications v0.2.4 build 499\r\n* Provider for working with Newshost\r\n* Support for unzipping NZBs delivered in ZIP format for use via the Black Hole method. Functionality for parsing NZBs delivered in ZIP format to SABnzbd is unaffected. The aforementioned support is for use with NNTP applications such as alt.binz to read the unzipped NZBs.\r\n\r\n### Purpose and Usage\r\nSick Beard for Newshost works no differently from the original, the only difference is that there is additional support and other modifications made to work within the limitations of Newshost itself. The core functionality and features remain intact and work the same way you're used to. It tries to keep up to date and mirror the changes of the official Sick Beard. The source as well as the binary version are available.\r\n\r\nIn order to authenticate with Newshost, obtain your user ID and pass key, they're the same details used for the RSS feed. Then add a provider as you would for others in Sick Beard and supply the required details in the text fields. These details can be found by viewing the page source and referring to line 5, the details you want is the data after `?id=` and `&pass=`.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n`?id=12345&pass=12345abcde67890fghij`\r\n\r\n### More About Sick Beard\r\n*Sick Beard is currently an alpha release.
